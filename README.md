## About ailia Tokenizer

The ailia Tokenizer is an NLP tokenizer that can be used from Unity or C++. The tokenizer is an API for converting text into tokens (sequences of symbols) that AI can handle, or for converting tokens back into text.

Traditionally, tokenization has been performed using Pytorch's Transformers. However, since Transformers only work with Python, there has been an issue of not being able to tokenize from applications on Android or iOS.

With ailia Tokenizer, this problem is solved by directly performing NLP tokenization without using Pytorch's Transforms. This makes it possible to perform tokenization on Android and iOS as well.

Since ailia Tokenizer includes Mecab and SentencePiece, it is possible to perform complex tokenizations, such as those for BERT Japanese or Sentence Transformer, on the device.
